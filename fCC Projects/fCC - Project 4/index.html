        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
        is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
        its environment to provide programmatic control over them. -Wikipedia

        React also known as React.js or ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library for        
        building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual 
        developers and companies.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page 
        or mobile applications. -Wikipedia

        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts. -Wikipedia

        Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and 
        designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let 
        application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java 
        code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. -

        Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. -Wikipedia
